## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Not getting traffic"
**Likely cause:** Content not yet indexed or keywords too competitive
**Solution:** Wait 2-4 weeks after publishing, focus on long-tail keywords in months 1-2

### "Low engagement (high bounce rate)"
**Likely cause:** Content not meeting user intent, poor formatting
**Solution:** Break content into shorter paragraphs, add more subheadings, improve intro

### "Ranked but not converting"
**Likely cause:** Weak CTA, form not visible, not clear what client gets
**Solution:** Add 2-3 CTAs per article, make consultation offer crystal clear

### "Can't keep up with schedule"
**Likely cause:** Writing takes longer than planned
**Solution:** Reduce quantity (aim for 2-3 pieces/week not 4-5), focus on quality

---

## Final Reminders

### Do This (Critical Success Factors)
- Start immediately (momentum matters)
- Publish consistently (2-3x per week)
- Link strategically (internal linking crucial)
- Optimize for SEO (before publishing)
- Distribute actively (don't rely on organic only)
- Track metrics (what gets measured gets improved)

### Don't Do This (Common Mistakes)
- Perfectionism (done > perfect)
- Keyword stuffing (100+ words on a 2000-word page)
- Ignoring distribution (70% of success)
- Writing without outline (wastes time)
- No internal linking (misses authority building)
- Publishing without proofreading (looks unprofessional)

---

## Questions to Answer Before Writing

Every article should answer:
1. **What problem does this solve?** (user intent)
2. **Who is reading this?** (target audience)
3. **What action do I want them to take?** (CTA)
4. **What keywords am I targeting?** (SEO)
5. **What does competition cover?** (unique angle)

If you can't answer all 5, outline more before writing.

---

## Next Steps (Do Today)

1. **Right now:** Read through main strategy document (Part 1-3)
2. **Tomorrow:** Complete all items in "Immediate Actions" section
3. **This week:** Finish first 5 article outlines
4. **Next Monday:** Publish first article

**You've got this! This is a realistic, achievable plan. Just execute Week 1, then reassess.**
