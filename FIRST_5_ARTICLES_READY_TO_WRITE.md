- "HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure"
- The S = Secure (SSL/TLS encryption)
- Like sending letters in sealed envelopes
- Data encrypted (only receiver can read)
- Website verified (you know it's real)
- Example: Password stays private

3. The Padlock: ההבדל הגלוי (120 words)
- In browser address bar:
  - HTTP: No lock symbol, says "Not Secure"
  - HTTPS: Green lock symbol, says "Secure"

  - Safe to enter personal info
- Screenshot examples would help here

- Check your bank website: HTTPS (with green lock)
- Check a spam site: HTTP (with warning)
- Look in address bar before entering data
- Never enter credit card on HTTP site
- Never enter password on HTTP site
- Safe to enter name/email on HTTP (but not ideal)

6. איך מתקנים את זה? (120 words)
- If your site is still HTTP:
  1. Contact your developer or host
  2. Takes 15 minutes to 1 day to fix
  3. Cost: Usually free (included with hosting)
  4. Or: It's actually 3 hours of dev work (150 ₪)
- Should be done immediately
- No reason not to have HTTPS
- Pro tip: Check your site is HTTPS before promoting

CTA (80 words)
- "Does your website have HTTPS?"
- Simple check: Look at address bar
- If not: Contact us for fix (we fix in 24 hours)
- Free assessment: We check your site for free
- Contact: WhatsApp 054-499-4417
```

- Action-oriented (how to check, how to fix)
- Use metaphors (postcards vs sealed envelopes)

### Internal Links (2)

2. "Services/Website Audit" (when created)

### Images to Add
- Screenshot: Chrome address bar with HTTP (warning)
- Screenshot: Chrome address bar with HTTPS (green lock)
- Infographic: HTTP (open envelope) vs HTTPS (locked envelope)

### Social Media Copy
```
דיד תודעים? בדיקה קטנה:
הכניסו לאתר שלכם בדפדפן.
בחזית הכתובת, תראו:
🔒 Lock (תהירים)
⚠️ Warning (לא בטוח)

אם תראו Warning = אתר שלכם לא מאובטח.

מה זה אומר?
- לקוחות לא יקנו
- גוגל לא דירג טוב
- מידע חשוף

קראו: HTTPS vs HTTP - ההבדל שמשנה הכל
